# disclosure

The Disclosure is a button that visually controls a piece of content.

## Features

- No DOM

  There is no actual DOM. It provides DOM Attributes by wrapping them around any
  component.

- SSR friendly

  By default, when a disclosure is closed, it does not remove the disclosure
  content from the DOM. This is important for SEO.

  Instead, it provides display: none as a style. This behavior is **completely
  controllable**.
